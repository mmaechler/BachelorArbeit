As we have seen, the algorithm works and is in many cases equal if not better 
to existing clustering methods. The approach is also very generalizable, with 
the biggest hurdle being an efficient implementation of a log-likelihood 
function and a parametrization strategy.
Should this approach be improved upon, it may provide a valuable tool in the
arsenal of mixture model analysis.

There are many directions further research in this area may be conducted. For 
instance, the initialization methods may prove to be an essential factor in 
correct model selection. Furthermore, in the case of CLARA, the parameters 
chosen are somewhat arbitrary. It could yield useful results how CLARA behaves 
with different sampling parameters.

The investigation conducted in this thesis also falls short in the study of 
high-dimensional datasets. While we have looked into it with the analysis of 
the {\tt SMI.12} data, the behaviour in these cases might also hold its own
difficulties, that have not cropped up in the study of one dataset.

Further research could also go in the direction of model selection theory. The 
Bayesian Information Criterion was chosen in this work for its reliable results
and usefulness, but other methods might yield more appropriate results.

There are also implementation related improvements, that could prove useful.
For example, as seen in figure \ref{fig:MW214bestfit}, spurious clusters are 
not accounted for at all in our implementation, which could strongly impact the
strength of this tool. This is most likely the most pressing issue with the 
implementation in this package, that no measures against spurious clusters
have been developed.
