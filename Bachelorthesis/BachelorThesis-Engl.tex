\begin{abstract}
	The intent of this work is to compare The EM algorithm to an MLE approach in 
    the	case of multivariate normal mixture models. 
	The EM algorithm is widely used in statistics and is proven to converge, 
	however in pathological cases convergence slows down considerably. 

    Our proposed alternative consists of a clustering algorithm as 
    initialization step, followed by a parametrization step, that is then fed 
    into a general optimizer.

    We compare two implementations of each algorithm with two different 
    initialization strategies by judging their performance in model selection.
    Model selection is decided by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

    The results are promising. In many cases MLE is equal or better than EM.
    It is certainly a competitive model selection strategy. This could yield
    improvements in the field of model selection. The algorithm design is also 
    versatile and translates easily to other problems.
