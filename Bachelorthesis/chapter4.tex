\chapter{Discussion}


one shortcoming is time inefficiency. largely due to implementation.
mclust has 16'000 lines of Fortran code, impossible in the scope of this thesis.

proof of concept??
definitely possible to do model selection using a general optimizer.

strong points:
'randomness' of clara/optim allows 'confidence intervalls' for selected model
flexibility of approach: given an logLik fctn can do mixture fitting w/ arbitrary
models

further study might include: other presumed component distributions, 'high' dimensions
