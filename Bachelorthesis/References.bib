    abstract = { There are few branches of the Theory of Evolution which appear to the mathematical statistician so much in need of exact treatment as those of Regression, Heredity, and Panmixia. Round the notion of panmixia much obscurity has accumulated, owing to the want of precise definition and quantitative measurement. The problems of regression and heredity have been dealt with by Mr. Francis Galton in his epochmaking work on ‘Natural Inheritance,’ but, although he has shown exact methods of dealing, both experimentally and mathematically, with the problems of inheritance, it does not appear that mathematicians have hitherto developed his treatment, or that biologists and medical men have yet fully appreciated that he has really shown how many of the problems which perplex them may receive at any rate a partial answer. A considerable portion of the present memoir will be devoted to the expansion and fuller development of Mr. Galton’s ideas, particularly their application to the problem of bi-parental inheritance. At the same time I shall endeavour to point out how the results apply to some current biological and medical problems. In the first place, we must definitely free our minds, in the present state of our knowledge of the mechanism of inheritance and reproduction, of any hope of reaching a mathematical relation expressing the degree of correlation between individual parent and individual offspring. The causes in any individual case of inheritance are far too complex to admit of exact treatment; and up to the present the classification of the circumstances under which greater or less degrees of correlation between special groups of parents and offspring may be expected has made but little progress. This is largely owing to a certain prevalence of almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity, which has usurped the place of that careful collection and elaborate experiment by which alone sufficient data might have been accumulated, with a view to ultimately narrowing and specialising the circumstances under which correlation was measured. We must proceed from inheritance in the mass to inheritance in narrower and narrwoer classes, rather than attempt to build up general rules on the observation of individual instances. Shortly, we must proceed by the method of statistics, rather than by the consideration of typical cases. It may seem discouraging to the medical practitioner, with the problem before him of inheritance in a particular family, to be told that nothing but averages, means, and probabilities with regard to large classes can as yet be scientifically dealt with ; but the very nature of the distribution of variation, whether healthy or morhid, seems to indicate that we are dealing with that sphere of indefinitely numerous small causes, which in so many other instances has shown itself only amenable to the calculus of chance, and not to any analysis of the individual instance. On the other hand, the mathematical theory wall be of assistance to the medical man by answering, inter alia, in its discussion of regression the problem as to the average effect upon the offspring of given degrees of morbid variation in the parents. It may enable the physician, in many cases, to state a belief based on a high degree of probability, if it offers no ground for dogma in individual cases. One of the most noteworthy results of Mr. Francis Galton’s researches is his discovery of the mode in which a population actually reproduces itself by regression and fraternal variation. It is with some expansion and fuller mathematical treatment of these ideas that this memoir commences. }

    abstract = {Gaussian clustering models are useful both for understanding and suggesting powerful criteria. Banfield and Raftery, Biometriks 49, 803–821 (1993), have considered a parameterization of the variance matrix Σk of a cluster Pk in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition, Σk = λkDkAkDk′ where λk defines the volume of Pk, Dk is an orthogonal matrix which defines its orientation and Ak is a diagonal matrix with determinant 1 which defines its shape. This parametrization allows us to propose many general clustering criteria from the simplest one (spherical clusters with equal volumes which leads to the classical k-means criterion) to the most complex one (unknown and different volumes, orientations and shapes for all clusters). Methods of optimization to derive the maximum likelihood estimates as well as the practical usefulness of these models are discussed. We especially analyse the influence of the volumes of clusters. We report Monte Carlo simulations and an application on stellar data which dramatically illustrated the relevance of allowing clusters to have different volumes.}

    abstract = {An exact and easily computable expression for the mean integrated squared error (MISE) for the kernel estimator of a general normal mixture density, is given for Gaussian kernels of arbitrary order. This provides a powerful new way of understanding density estimation which complements the usual tools of simulation and asymptotic analysis. The family of normal mixture densities is very flexible and the formulae derived allow simple exact analysis for a wide variety of density shapes. A number of applications of this method giving important new insights into kernel density estimation are presented. Among these is the discovery that the usual asymptotic approximations to the MISE can be quite inaccurate, especially when the underlying density contains substantial fine structure and also strong evidence that the practical importance of higher order kernels is surprisingly small for moderate sample sizes.},
