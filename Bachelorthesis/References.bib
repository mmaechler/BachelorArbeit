 abstract = {An exact and easily computable expression for the mean integrated squared error (MISE) for the kernel estimator of a general normal mixture density, is given for Gaussian kernels of arbitrary order. This provides a powerful new way of understanding density estimation which complements the usual tools of simulation and asymptotic analysis. The family of normal mixture densities is very flexible and the formulae derived allow simple exact analysis for a wide variety of density shapes. A number of applications of this method giving important new insights into kernel density estimation are presented. Among these is the discovery that the usual asymptotic approximations to the MISE can be quite inaccurate, especially when the underlying density contains substantial fine structure and also strong evidence that the practical importance of higher order kernels is surprisingly small for moderate sample sizes.},

abstract = "Gaussian clustering models are useful both for understanding and suggesting powerful criteria. Banfield and Raftery, Biometriks 49, 803–821 (1993), have considered a parameterization of the variance matrix Σk of a cluster Pk in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition, Σk = λkDkAkDk′ where λk defines the volume of Pk, Dk is an orthogonal matrix which defines its orientation and Ak is a diagonal matrix with determinant 1 which defines its shape. This parametrization allows us to propose many general clustering criteria from the simplest one (spherical clusters with equal volumes which leads to the classical k-means criterion) to the most complex one (unknown and different volumes, orientations and shapes for all clusters). Methods of optimization to derive the maximum likelihood estimates as well as the practical usefulness of these models are discussed. We especially analyse the influence of the volumes of clusters. We report Monte Carlo simulations and an application on stellar data which dramatically illustrated the relevance of allowing clusters to have different volumes."
