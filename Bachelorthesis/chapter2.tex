\chapter{The {\tt norMmix} Package}


\section{Introduction to the {\tt norMmix} Package}
\label{sec:nMm}

For this thesis, an \Rp package was developed that implements an algorithm
that fits multivariate normal mixtures to given data.
\footnote{The package was written with \Rp version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) last 
updated on 2019-10-22.}

The algorithm is reasonably straightforward:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize using a common clustering algorithm.
    \item Perform one m-step, to transform clustering results into the form of a
        normal mixture.
    \item Apply a general optimizer, using the mixture's log-likelihood function.
\end{enumerate}

The {\tt norMmix} package is constructed around the {\tt norMmix} object that 
codifies a {\tt nor}mal {\tt M}ultivariate {\tt mix}ture model,  and the {\tt 
llnorMmix()} function, that calculates the log-likelihood given a model and 
data.

In the table \ref{tab:code-notation} the notation used in code is listed
along with a translation to the previously used mathematical notation.
Additionally, functions with ambiguous names are listed here.

The package contains the following functionality:
\begin{table}
\begin{description}
    \item [norMmix] {\tt norMmix()} is the 'init-method' for 
        {\tt norMmix} objects. There exist {\tt is.norMmix} {\tt rnorMmix} and
        {\tt dnorMmix} functions.
    \item [parametrization] The main functions that handle reparametrization
        of models from and to the $\pmb{LDL}^\top$ decomposition are 
        {\tt nMm2par} and {\tt par2nMm}, which are inverse to each other.
    \item [MLE] The function {\tt norMmixMLE} marries the main components of 
        this package. It initializes a model and parametrizes it for use with 
        {\tt optim}
    \item [model choice] Using {\tt norMmixMLE}, the function fitnMm allows 
        fitting of multiple models and components. Functions analyzing the 
        output of this are also provided, e.g. {\tt BIC} and {\tt print} methods.
    \item [example objects] Following the paper of \cite{Mar92} various example
        objects are provided and used for study. They follow the naming 
        convention: MW + dimension + number. For example {\tt MW213} for the 
        13th model of dimension 2.
    \item [simulations] A good portion of the package is designed with the study 
        of simulations in mind. Therefore there are functions provided to study 
        large collections of evaluated data. e.g {\tt compplot}
    \item [misc] There are also various methods of generics, like {\tt logLik,
        print, BIC, AIC} and {\tt nobs} as well as various {\tt print} methods.
\end{description}
\end{table}

The package relies on {\tt optim} from the {\tt stats} package \cite{sta19} 
for general optimization. We use the standard method implemented in {\tt optim} 
which is {\tt BFGS}, which is a quasi-Newton method (also known as a variable 
metric algorithm) as described in \cite{Bro70} among others. 

The workflow when using the package is as follows.
The function {\tt rnorMmix} can be used to generate data from a {\tt norMmix} 
object. The {\tt MW} objects provide ready made examples and objects of study
and the {\tt norMmix} function can be used to define normal mixtures from 
scratch. Of course, other data sets can be used for analysis. The following 
functions rely, however, on the {\tt matrix} data structure. So data frames 
must be converted beforehand and non numerical data is not accepted.

The functions that accept it for analysis are mainly {\tt norMmixMLE} and 
{\tt fitnMm}. The former performs model fit on data, and the latter performs 
model selection, by calling {\tt norMmixMLE} for specified {\tt k} and 
{\tt model} vectors. 

\subsection{{\tt norMmixMLE}}

The core of {\tt norMmixMLE} is the application of {\tt optim} in conjunction
with {\tt llnorMmix} as function to be optimized. {\tt llnorMmix} can be 
accessed directly, however, it needs a transposed dataset.
The {\tt norMmixMLE} function implicitly performs initialization.

There are two options for this initialization step. One is the CLARA clustering
algoritm, with non-standard arguments. The standard arguments are somewhat 
historic in origin and were, at the time, chosen because of hardware 
limitations. The arguments used in this work are defined by a function, due to 
this thesis' advisor Martin M\"achler, which was designed to be a 'sensible' 
alternative, but should be subject to further scrutiny. It is reproduced here.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
>     norMmix:::ssClaraL
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
function (n, k, p) 
pmin(n, pmax(40, round(10 * log(n))) + round(2 * k * pmax(1, 
    log(n * p))))
<bytecode: 0x45358d8>
<environment: namespace:norMmix>
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

It is dependent on the size and dimension of the dataset, as well as the 
demanded number of clusters.

The alternative to CLARA is {\tt mclust}'s hierarchical agglomerative 
clustering, which follows the work of \cite{Fra98}. The intention behind using 
{\tt mclust}'s initialization function is to directly compare how much 
difference the initialization process makes.

The initialization stage does not yield a normal mixture. This requires a way
to transform a clustering into a mixture. The method chosen in this package is
to use an m-step from the EM-algorithm. Unlike the EM-algorithm, clustering 
algorithms like CLARA produce binary cluster membership results, whereas the 
component membership of EM is determined as a probability value between 0 and 1.
This is resolved by interpreting the results as probability values which are 
either 0 or 1. These are then used as the $\tau_j$ as described in section 
\ref{sec:sketch}. This m-step is also taken from the {\tt mclust} package for 
reasons better explained in section \ref{sec:devel}.
It has the advantage of being able to generate a mixture object with the 
correct covariance model.

This mixture object is still in human readable form and not the necessary 
parameter vector demanded by {\tt optim}. So an application of the function
{\tt nMm2par} is carried out, resulting in a starting value for {\tt optim}.

The returned results from {\tt norMmixMLE} are more than abundant. Not only is 
the fitted model returned but also everything produced by {\tt optim} and the 
entire dataset. Here the return values are listed:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

Besides {\tt mclust} and {\tt cluster}, the package also relies on a number of other packages for 
various tasks. Listed in no particular order: 
{\tt MASS} \cite{mas02}, 
{\tt mvtnorm} \cite{mvt19}, 
{\tt mixtools} \cite{mix09} and 
{\tt sfsmisc} \cite{sfs19}.


\section{On The Development of {\tt norMmix}}
\label{sec:devel}

During the development of the {\tt norMmix} package several mistakes were made
and dead-ends were reached. In the interest of documentation, we discuss some
of them in this section. 

One dead-end was the parametrization of the weights of a mixture using the 
{\tt logit} function.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> logit <- function(e) {
+     stopifnot(is.numeric(e) ,all(e >= 0), all.equal(sum(e),1))
+     qlogis(e[-1L])
+ }
> logitinv <- function(e) {
+     if (length(e)==0) {return(c(1))}
+     stopifnot(is.numeric(e))
+     e<- plogis(e)
+     sp. <- sum(e)
+     w <- c((1-sp.), e)
+ }
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

This uses the logistical function {\tt logis} to transform to reduce the number
of weights from $K$ to $K-1$. Much like {\tt clr1}, given a list of weights 
{\tt logit} will transform them and {\tt logitinv} will correctly reverse the 
transformation. However, unlike {\tt clr1}, it will not transform an arbitrary 
list of length $K-1$ into a valid weight parameter. For example:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> w <- runif(7); ret <- logitinv(w)
> ret
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] -3.1906158  0.6511258  0.5136217  0.5337424  0.5794803  0.6053432  0.5846750
[8]  0.7226274
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

The issue here is that the last line of {\tt logitinv}, which is necessary to 
sum to one, but results in a negative value in {\tt ret[1]} which is not a 
valid weight. The underlying issue is that not every tuple in $\R^{K-1}$ is 
a result of {\tt logit}.

The option to use {\tt logit} is still an argument to {\tt norMmixMLE} by 
specifying {\tt trafo="logit"}, but it shouldn't be used.

Another issue during development cropped up during fitting of high dimensional
data. We studied the dataset {\tt SMI.12} from the package {\tt copula}, 
\cite{cop18}:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> data(SMI.12, package="copula")
> str(SMI.12)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 num [1:141, 1:20] 16.1 15.7 15.7 16.1 16.6 ...
 - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  ..$ : chr [1:141] "2011-09-09" "2011-09-12" "2011-09-13" "2011-09-14" ...
  ..$ : chr [1:20] "ABBN" "ATLN" "ADEN" "CSGN" ...
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

A consequence of high dimensions is that matrix multiplication is no longer
very stable. As a result, the covariance matrices produced by our own 
implementation of the EM-algorithms m-step ({\tt mstep.nMm}) were not positive
definite.
In the case of {\tt SMI.12}, several covariance matrices are degenerate, which
results in cancellation error with near-zero entries.
We attempted to correct this with the function {\tt forcePositive}, which 
simply tries to set $\pmb{D}$ in $\pmb{LDL}^\top$ greater than zero.
This didn't resolve the issue, since a non-negligible part of the numerical
error was in the $\pmb{L}$ matrix and the resultant covariance matrix was still
not positive definite.

We eventually resolved this issue by abandoning our own implementation and 
using the functions from the {\tt Mclust} package. Not only were these 
numerically stable they were also able to differentiate between models, whereas
ours would assume VVV for every fit.


\section{Demonstration}

To end this chapter, here a small demonstration of the capabilities of 
{\tt norMmix}. First a small plot to show an MW mixture.
